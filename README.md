# Crypto-Visualization
# About
The project, built with Power BI, displays charts and predicts future trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. The charts help us see how the prices go up and down, and we can also check the trading volume. This project is handy because it not only shows what happened in the past but also tries to predict what might happen next.
